jkpdftool
=========

A tool I have written for myself to prepare a perfect printout of unusual documents.

* Scale to another page size
* Crop margins
* Add margins
* Print two pages per sheet
* Split and merge PDF files

Your printer driver should be able to handle all of this, but this tool can
avoid extra dead trees compared to fiddling with the print settings.
