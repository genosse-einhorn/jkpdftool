jkpdftool
=========

A set of tools I have written for myself to prepare a perfect printout 
of annoying documents. The following tools are provided:

  jkpdftool-crop          Remove margins around content
  jkpdftool-nup           N-up content, i.e. multiple pages on one sheet
  jkpdftool-pagefit       Fit content into a given page size
  jkpdftool-rotate        Rotate content
  jkpdftool-splice        Split and merge pages from multiple files

All tools read from stdin and write the result to stdout. This means you 
can chain them to perform complex tasks. 

Usage Example
-------------

Crop margins, fit into A5 and the double up onto one A4 page:

  <IN.pdf jkpdftool-crop | jkpdftool-pagefit -s A5 | jkpdftool-nup 2x1 >OUT.pdf


Dependencies
------------

* GLib    (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib)
* poppler (https://poppler.freedesktop.org/)
* cairo   (https://cairographics.org/)

Any recent versions shipped with your favorite linux distro should be fine.

You also need a C11 compiler. Development uses gcc, but clang should work, too.
